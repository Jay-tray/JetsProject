#Jets Program

- Week 3 SD homework assignment **Jets Project**

#Description

- Asked to create an application that read a .txt file in to populate aircraft to specific classes. Those classes extended an abstract class and additionally had specific interfaces that implemented actions based on type of aircraft. In addition we added a user menu that allows user to select from 9 options that reveal the fleet of aircraft, their range when they fly, the fastest, the longest range, case specific type options and the ability to add/remove aircraft. 

#Tech Used

- Eclipse
- Terminal
- Git/Github


#Lessons learned

- Many lessons this time around! 
- Initially the use of abstract classes/interfaces and getting to practice with extends/implement
- Developing an abstract class that provides adequate info for the classes that will utilize it
- Had issues organizing where specific data should live. Followed the baseline UML provided and amplified it with additional information but still need to work on creating a very solid "rough draft" before I begin to put product into eclipse.
- try/catch and importing .txt files is still very foreign and will need to keep working with them to have a better idea. 
- Just trying when you're not sure is what I need to keep working on!
